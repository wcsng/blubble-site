<h4> <b> Our Vision </b></h4>
<p> BluBLE is an initiative by researchers at <a href="https://wcsng.ucsd.edu">WCSNG Lab UCSD</a>, to help communities in the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. We have been leading the research efforts in harnessing wireless signals to sense the environment and localize human beings in it. This aspect of localization of human beings opens up tremendous opportunities to effectively fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<!-- 
<p>The aspect of localization of human beings in an environment could help out the communities in effectively enforcing unforeseen protocols like social distancing, self-quarantining & contact tracing, which are at the frontlines in this fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns help in enforcing these protocols, but they have had a drastic effect on economic and social conditions of people across the world. Hence, to again open up our streets and public spaces, we need to be able to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>ubiquitous</em> system that alerts you if someone comes closer than 6 ft to you or warns about specific indoor spaces having a higher likelihood of COVID-19 </li>
<li>A <em>private and voluntary</em> system which will effectively anonymize contact tracking and location tagging. </li>
</ul> -->
<!-- <p> BluBLE, a wordplay between BLE and bubble, conveys very succinctly what we intend to achieve. Basically, we want to utilize Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons in order to classify the 6ft safe bubble you should be in, to maximize your social distancing effectiveness until the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. To this end, we are utilizing crowd-sourced data collection via various data collection apps we have developed. Please checkout our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/categories">Data Collection</a> page to help us out by contributing to the project. The below figure visually illustrates our technical approach.</p>

<!-- <p> <b> How do wireless signals help in achieving the above points? </b> Wireless signals get weaker as they travel more distance over the air. You would've observed this with your Wi-Fi router, the closer you go to it the better signal you get. This same phenomena, applied to Bluetooth wireless signals emitted by smartphones, which have almost become <em>ubiquitous</em> across the entire world, could be used to infer if there is another person within 6 ft from you. Furthermore, we can make all the people in the environment collaborate, with help of wireless signals exchanged between them, in order to perform <em>private and voluntary</em> localization of a sick person nearby.</p> -->
<p> In a nutshell, BluBLE aims to protect you in a protective bubble throughout your day and provides you with personalized risk scores which indicate your probability of having contacted COVID-19. With BluBLE, we hope to bring you peace of mind the next time you're at a grocery store or just going out for a run. </p>

Notably, algorithms framed by BLoc have also been adopted in the Bluetooth standards in order to obtain fine-grained localization.
